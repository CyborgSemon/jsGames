# jsGames
A bunch of games made in javascript because why not :)

To play the games, clone or download the repo and open up `index.html`. This will open up the "hub" that will display all of the games. From here, you can click on any of the games and it will open in a new tab.

If you find any bugs, take a screen shot and open an issue on GitHub.

Enjoy!
